# DataStax Desktop - C# Netflix example
An introduction to using the Cassandra database with well-defined steps to optimize your learning.  Using a Netflix dataset for sample data, your locally running Cassandra database will contain a minimal set of show data for you to customize and experiment with.

Contributors:

## Objectives
* Leverage DataStax driver APIs for interaction with a local running Cassandra database.
* Set up a Cassandra Query Language (CQL) session and perform operations such as creating, reading, and writing.
* Visualize how the CQL is used with builder patterns provided by the DataStax driver APIs.
* Use the Netflix show dataset as example information across three differently constructed tables.
* Observe how the partition key along with clustering keys produce an optimized experience.

## Project Layout

* [Program.cs](/Netflix/Program.cs) - C# application file demonstrating the capabilities of Cassandra with Netflix examples.
* [Netflix.csproj](/Netflix/Netflix.csproj) - Visual Studio .NET C# Project file

## How this works
To get started, read the `main()` method of the Program class and follow the steps for interacting with your own Cassandra database.
The methods invoked by the `main()` method are created to provide
more flexibility for modifications as you learn.

## Setup and running

### Prerequisites

* A running instance of [Apache CassandraÂ®](http://cassandra.apache.org/download/) 1.2+
* [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) with .NET Core 2.1+
* IDE Alternatives: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)

If running [DataStax Desktop](https://www.datastax.com/blog/2020/05/learn-cassandra-datastax-desktop), no prerequisites are required. The Cassandra instance is provided with the DataStax
Desktop stack as part of container provisioning.

If not using DataStax Desktop, spin up your own local instance of Cassandra exposing its address and
port to align with settings in the `main()` method of the file `Netflix/Program.cs`.

### Running
Verify your Cassandra database is running in your local container.

Run the C# `main()` method inside the Netflix Program class. View the console output for steps executed and check for the following output:
