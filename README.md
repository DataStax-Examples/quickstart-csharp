# DataStax C# Driver for Apache Cassandra Quickstart

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/beccam/quickstart-csharp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/beccam/quickstart-csharp)

A basic C#/.NET demo CRUD application using the DataStax C# Driver for Apache Cassandra. 
If you are having trouble, the complete code solution for `Program.cs` can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/beccam/5abab3b4072d5a0027475481f1d5075f).

## Objectives

* To demonstrate how to perform basic CRUD operations with the DataStax C# Driver.
* The intent is to help users get up and running quickly with the driver. 

## Project Layout

* [Program.cs](/QuickStart/Program.cs) - Skeleton C# application with space to fill in CRUD operation code
* [QuickStart.csproj](/QuickStart/QuickStart.csproj) - Visual Studio .NET C# Project file
* [users.cql](/QuickStart/users.cql) - Use this file to create the schema

## Prerequisites
  * A running instance of [Apache CassandraÂ®](http://cassandra.apache.org/download/) 1.2+
  * [Mircosoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) with .NET Core 2.1+
  * IDE Alternatives: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
  
  
## Create the keyspace and table
The `users.cql` file provides the schema used for this project:

```sql
CREATE KEYSPACE demo
    WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': '1'};

CREATE TABLE demo.users (
    lastname text PRIMARY KEY,
    age int,
    city text,
    email text,
    firstname text);
```

## Connect to your cluster

All of our code is contained in the `Program` class. 
Note how the main method creates a session to connect to our cluster and runs the CRUD operations against it. 
Replace the default parameter in `Cluster.Builder()` with your own contact point.

```csharp
// TO DO: Fill in your own contact point
Cluster cluster = Cluster.Builder()
                         .AddContactPoint("127.0.0.1")
                         .Build();
ISession session = cluster.Connect("demo");
```

## CRUD Operations
Fill the code in the methods that will add a user, get a user, update a user and delete a user from the table with the driver.

### INSERT a user
```csharp
private static void SetUser(ISession session, String lastname, int age, String city, String email, String firstname) {
    
    //TO DO: execute SimpleStatement that inserts one user into the table
    var statement = new SimpleStatement("INSERT INTO users (lastname, age, city, email, firstname) VALUES (?,?,?,?,?)", lastname, age, city, email, firstname);

    session.Execute(statement);
}
```
### SELECT a user
```csharp
 private static void GetUser(ISession session, String lastname){

      //TO DO: execute SimpleStatement that retrieves one user from the table
      //TO DO: print firstname and age of user
      var statement = new SimpleStatement("SELECT * FROM users WHERE lastname = ?", lastname);
      
      var result = session.Execute(statement).First();
      Console.WriteLine("{0} {1}", result["firstname"], result["age"]);

}
```

### UPDATE a user's age
```csharp
private static void UpdateUser(ISession session, int age, String lastname) {

    //TO DO: execute SimpleStatement that updates the age of one user
    var statement = new SimpleStatement("UPDATE users SET age =? WHERE lastname = ?", age, lastname);

    session.Execute(statement);
}
```   

### DELETE a user
```csharp
private static void DeleteUser(ISession session, String lastname) {

    //TO DO: execute SimpleStatement that deletes one user from the table
    var statement = new SimpleStatement("DELETE FROM users WHERE lastname = ?", lastname);

    session.Execute(statement);
}
```
